### About the book
The reason I wrote this is because I wanted to learn how the academic writings are made, also to learn the statistics field in a unique way. The main purpose of the book is to be a handbook or a notebook for my personal uses. You can find source code below.
The book consists of 3 parts. **Probability, Statistical Inference and Data mining**. Each section have multiple chapters, references and exercises. Each exercise subsection have **R simulation practices with visualizations**

The chapters are structured in a very abstract and short way. When I wrote this, I imagined that I was talking with myself. I really don't know how to explain it, I recommend skimming through the book to understand the way the book is written.

To learn the field and write this book, I used various books from known authors, countless mathematics forums about statistics and probability, wikipedia (duh-duh) articles, and MIT OpenCourseWare. These are all the major sources I used while writing the book.
* Larry Wasserman - All of Statistics - A Concise Course in Statistical Inference.
* Probability and Statistics by Morris H. DeGroot and Mark J. Schervish.
* R for Data Science.
* MIT OpenCourseWare Introduction to Probability and Statistics, spring 2022.

# How to use the book
As the book is precise and short, you may use the book as a revisit or a secondary material. The book shortly and simply explains the concepts and ideas. Important concepts' proofs are provided. However, other proofs explaned in sentences rather than other classic rigorous proofs.

# R source code
In this book, I mainly used **tidyverse** packages to plot, visualize, model, clean data and more. My IDE for R is Rstudio. You can find R source code in my github, in src directory.
