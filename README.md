# NOTICE: THE BOOK IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

### About the book's purpose
This is a small book about **Probability and Statistics** with some Python code applications. The book is written for educational and entertainment purposes. I like to learn topics by writing notes, and I though it would be neat project to write a book like this. Read the **Preface** of the book for more information.


### How to use the book
You can use the book as review material. Remember that I am not a professional academician with big mathematics background. I am just a student that has interest in math and programming. You can find more information about the book in **Preface** section of the book.

### Practical Python applications
In some chapters where practical applications are needed, I used Python (and rarely C/C++ for optimization). Again, you can find more information in the book.

### The book is open source!
You can find my **LaTeX configuration** in the file **config.sty**. It is very well documented and you can use the things you like on your projects.

In **diagrams** folder, you can find the source code of the illustrations written in python and tikz, a latex library.
