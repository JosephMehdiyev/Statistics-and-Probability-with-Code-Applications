# NOTICE: The book is not finished.

### About the book's purpose
I wanted to know how a academic stuff (papers, articles, books and so on) are written. I also wanted to rigirously learn Probability and Statistics. So, I thought it would be a fun and very educational project to write an amateur book. I might also translate this book to my native language (azerbaijani) and publish it, since there are no such sources in azerbaijani.


### How to use the book
You can use the book as review material. Remember that I am not a professor with years of teaching experience. I am just a student that has interest in math and programming. So, be warned.

### Practical exercises and codes
At the end of the every chapters, there are exercies that I gathered from around the internet, with solutions. Practice is a good way to learn the topic, and I also used them for myself.
In some sections, I am planning to write code to demonstrate some concepts in C/C++ and Python. There are no such thing, yet.

### The book is open source!
You can find my **LaTeX configuration** in the file **config.sty**. It contains the visual settings of the book. It is very well documented (I think) and you can use the things you like on your projects and books.


In **diagrams** folder, you can find the source code of the illustrations. I am planning to make the diagrams after I finish the core of the book.
