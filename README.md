### About the book
This literature is more of like a personal handbook/notebook in the style of the book (in fact, this is not a book, but I still call it like that). The book is for personal use, and is not for commercial purposes.
The book is just the collection of my notes about statistics and probability. I have organized all of my notes into this piece. This is not supposed to be a proper book.
The book consists of three parts. **Probability, Statistical Inference and Statistical Models/Data Mining**. Each section have multiple chapters, references and exercises.
To learn the field and write this book, I used various books from known authors, countless mathematics forums about statistics and probability, wikipedia (duh-duh) articles, and MIT OpenCourseWare. These are all the major sources I used while writing the book.
* Larry Wasserman - All of Statistics - A Concise Course in Statistical Inference.
* Probability and Statistics by Morris H. DeGroot and Mark J. Schervish.
* R for Data Science.
* MIT OpenCourseWare Introduction to Probability and Statistics, spring 2022.

### How to use the book
As the book is precise and short, you may use the book as a revisit or a secondary material. The book shortly and simply explains the concepts and ideas. Important concepts' proofs are provided. However, other proofs explaned in sentences rather than other classic rigorous proofs.

### R source code
Each chapter have exercises with simulation problems. I provide solutions with **R**.

In this book, I mainly used **tidyverse** packages to plot, visualize, model, clean data and more. My IDE for R is Rstudio. You can find R source code in my github, in src directory.
### How to compile the book.
Clone the directory and run your system's latex compile command on **main.tex**.
### Roadmap
* **Learn and Write linear statistical models, regression:** 
* **Learn and Write Bayesian Inference:** Currently my knowledge is only about frequentist inference. I am planning to learn the Bayesian side once I mastered the the frequentists.
* **Simulation Exercises:** Add R practice problems with solutions to each chapter. Currenly, specific chapters have it.
