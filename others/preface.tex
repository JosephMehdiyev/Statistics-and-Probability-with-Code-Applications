\chapter*{Preface}

\section*{About the Book}
This book is sort of a big notebook to make (or force) the author to self study and understand the field of Probability and Statistics.
I have to note that this book is an educational and fun project for the author himself. Through the book, author tries to explain the topics to \textit{himself} .Be careful using the book as the main learning material, since the writer himself is not an expert in the field, there may be mathematical errors in the book.

\par
To learn the field and write this book, I used various books from known authors and wikipedia (duh-duh) articles. These are some of the books I used majority of time:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Larry Wasserman - All of Statistics - A Concise Course in Statistical Inference.
    \item Dimitri Bertsekas And John N Tsitsiklis - Introduction To Probability
    \item Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Dennis Wackerly, William Mendenhall, and Richard L. Scheaffer
    \item Joseph K. Blitzstein - Introduction to Probability
    \item Ross, Sheldon - First Course in Probability
  \end{itemize}
I want to note that I did not, by any means, plagiarize any contents, diagrams or other things. I simply wrote whatever I learnt through the the brainstorm.
  

\subsubsection*{Book's source}
Maybe you may already know this, this book is fully open source with its pictures and tex file shared in author's \href{https://github.com/JosephMehdiyev}{github}. You may use the source code for whatever purposes you want to use it for. If you want to contribute, please send a pull request from the github.Currently the book is in development.

\section*{How to use the Book}
Without the unnecessary historical chapters and big exercises, you may use the book as a revisit or a secondary material. The book tries to be very explanatory and precise about the mathematical concepts.
