\section*{About the Book}
This literature is more of like a personal handbook/notebook in the style of the book. The book is for personal use, and is not for commercial purposes. All the source files can be found in the github account, and all the references used are can be found in the reference sections of the each chapter (Also, the general sources are credited below).\\
The book is just the collection of my notes about statistics and probability. I have organized all of my notes into this piece. This is not supposed to be a proper book.\\
The book consists of $3$ parts. \textbf{Probability, Statistical Inference and Statistical Models/Data Mining}. Each section have multiple chapters, references and exercises. Each exercise subsection have \textbf{R/Python simulation practices and machine learning examples with visualizations}

To learn the field and write this book, I used various books from known authors, countless mathematics forums about statistics and probability, wikipedia (duh-duh) articles, and MIT OpenCourseWare. These are all the major sources I used while learning the statistics and probability. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Larry Wasserman - All of Statistics - A Concise Course in Statistical Inference.
    \item Probability and Statistics by Morris H. DeGroot and Mark J. Schervish.
    \item R for Data Science.
    \item An Introduction To Statistical Learning with R/Python (ISLR/ISLP)
    \item MIT OpenCourseWare Introduction to Probability and Statistics, spring 2022.
    \item Countless Wikipedia Articles.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Book's source}
This book is fully open source with its source code shared in author's \href{https://github.com/JosephMehdiyev}{github}. You may use the source code for whatever purposes you want to use it for. If you have questions about the book or its source code, you may contact me with my email: yusifmehdiyev55@gmail.com 


\section*{Code source code}
\textbf{Note that the book is still being written, so you may not find that much code source.}\\
In this book, I mainly used \textbf{tidyverse} packages to plot, visualize, model, clean data and more. My IDE for R is \textbf{RStudio}. You can find R source code in my github, in src directory.
\\
For Machine learning and other data science purposes, I used python library \textbf{pytorch} and related libraries. I use Neovim/Vim for Python.
