\chapter*{Preface}
This  thing is abandoned now, I wanted it to be a notebook to prove I have actually self-studied the topic but this is really pointless (I
am so naive and stupid!).

Please be warned that this PDF probably contains plagiarilism from the books I have read, this is a failed personal project anyways, do not
take it seriously.
