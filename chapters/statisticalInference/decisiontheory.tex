\chapter{Statistical Decision Theory}
Statistical Decision Theory is widely used in machine learning fields, for example training neural networks and other statistical models via computers.\\ 
There are multiple methods of generating estimators. Decision Theory helps us decide which method is more suited for our job.\\
The ``relationship'' between $\theta$ and $\t$ can be measured with a \textbf{loss function} $L(\theta, \t)$. The examples are,
\begin{align*}
        &\text{Squared Error Loss} \quad (\theta - \t)^2\\
        &\text{absolute Error Loss} \quad |\theta - \t|1\\
        &L_p \text{Loss} \quad |\theta - \t|^p
\end{align*}
We kind of already studied these functions before.
\section{Risk Function}
To judge the estimators, we use average of loss, or \textbf{risk}.
\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{risk} of an estimator $\t$ is,
    \[ R(\theta, \t) = \E\left(L(\theta, \t)\right)\]
    Notice that if our loss function is squared error,
    \[ R(\theta ,\t) = \op{MSE}(\theta,\t)\]
\end{definition}
